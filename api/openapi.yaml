    \ all around the world in just a few lines of code.\n\nTo authenticate, users\
    \ must send their email, password, and session ID to the **[`/api/auth`](/operations/getAuthToken)**\
    \ endpoint. Upon successful authentication, an API token will be provided. This\
    \ token should be included in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token for\
    \ all subsequent requests.\n    \nAlternatively, you can copy your API key directly\
    \ from our **[`console`](https://console.4players.io)** by opening any app, and\
    \ then going to **Settings -> API Keys**."

          Filter by metadata. Allows filtering based on metadata key-value pairs, supporting both simple and nested metadata fields using dot notation.

          **Simple Filters:**
          To filter where `idle` is false (boolean):
          ```
          filter[metadata]=idle=false
          ```

          To filter where `string` is exactly "a":
          ```
          filter[metadata]=string="a"
          ```

          **Filtering for Null Values:**
          To filter for a native null value, use unquoted null. For example, to filter where `score` is null:
          ```
          filter[metadata]=score=null
          ```

          **Nested Filters:**
          For nested metadata fields use dot notation. For example, to filter where `difficulty` within `gameSettings.survival`
          is exactly "hardcore":
          ```
          filter[metadata]=gameSettings.survival.difficulty="hardcore"
          ```

          To filter for a nested field with a native `null` value, leave the null unquoted:
          ```
          filter[metadata]=gameSettings.stats.score=null
          ```

          **Array Contains Filter:**
          To filter where an array contains a given value (string, number, boolean or null):
          ```
          filter[metadata]=players="foobar"
          filter[metadata]=player_ids=37
          filter[metadata]=array=true
          filter[metadata]=array=null
          ```

          Works for nested arrays as well:
          ```
          filter[metadata]=gameData.players="foobar"
          ```

          **Multiple Filters:**
          Combine multiple filters by separating them with commas:
          ```
          filter[metadata]=idle=false,max_players=20,gameSettings.survival.difficulty="hardcore"
          ```
        explode: true
        in: query
        name: "filter[metadata]"
        required: false
        schema:
          type: string
        style: form
      - description: |-
          Allows sorting of results. By default, sorting is in ascending order. To reverse the order, prepend the sort key with a hyphen (-).

          **Simple Sort:** To sort by id in ascending order or by instance in descending order:

          ```
          sort[]=id
          sort[]=-instance
          ```

          **Multiple Sorts:** Combine multiple sorts by separating them with commas:
          ```
          sort[]=id&sort[]=-instance
          ```
